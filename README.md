# Heart_Disease_Classification
Use different classification supervised learning to classify heart disease problem

During this project, 2 things I need to deal with and I break it down into 2 parts: part 1 for EDA and part 2 for models.
In part 1, it is good to show the dataset named "heart.csv" (you can find it on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset ). After, some visualizations will be shown and some preprocessing techniques will be shown too. 

n part 2, 4 models are introduced (Logistic, KNN, XGBoost, and SVC). Furthermore, to evaluate model, I did use some accuarcy metrics and a confusion matrix to describe the performance
